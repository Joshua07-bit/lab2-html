# lab2-html
# This lab focuses on creating a well-structured HTML5 webpage while following best practices for semantic HTML and validation.

# Setting Up the Project
## Students begin by creating a project folder named lab2-html in VS Code. Inside this folder, two files are created:
index.html (the main HTML file)
README.md (a brief project description)

# Building a Structured HTML5 Page
## The index.html file is populated with a basic HTML5 structure, including:
A header with a website title and navigation menu.
A main section containing an article and sidebar for additional links.
A footer with copyright details.

# Validating HTML with W3C
We should validate their index.html file using the W3C Validator, fix any errors, and ensure the code is fully compliant.
